                        <p>
                            Music has been around for centuries. Ancient people used to sing and even play their unique
                            musical instruments, just as we do now. Their songs have become the cultural heritage of
                            different peoples. The founders of <span class="accent">Music Store</span>, Abdumalik
                            Alphabethayev and
                            Rovshan Abevegedeyev, were always fascinated by this fact and wanted to devote their lives
                            to music. Even though they did not become world-famous musicians, they started to
                            manufacture and sell national Uzbek instruments.

                        <p>In 2010, they founded Music Store company, which was when the story of our music shop began.
                            Since then, the company has been operating in Tashkent successfully. It has been through
                            many ups and downs, but the company's way was bright and inspiring.</p>

                        <p>
                            Currently, Music Store is a highly-modern and stylish music shop that is distributing most
                            modern, stylish, and high-quality music instruments and studio equipment. Its building,
                            located at 98-A Mukimi Street, Tashkent, is operating seven days a week to make sure each
                            customer is served whenever he or she needs it. We are collaborating with world-famous
                            brands, such as Yamaha, Fender, and Gibson, and selling their production.

                        <p>The most optimal conditions are created in our shop to make sure the instruments are
                            well-kept. This way, they do not lose their characteristics by being exposed to hot or cold
                            weather. In addition to that, in our shop, local musicians organize regular workshops for
                            those who want to learn how to
                            play the guitar or piano.</p>

                            It is hard to see (or hear!) the future clearly. However, we hope that future people will
                            love music as much as we do! Our little music shop
                            has been actively contributing to the development of music industry of the Republic of
                            Uzbekistan by promoting love to music, sponsoring local cultural events, and making musical
                            instruments available to many
                            families.
